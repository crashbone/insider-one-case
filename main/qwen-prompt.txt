Hey QWEN!

You are in a backend & frontend project. After this project is complete, users should be able to use this project in order to create:

- A template, representing a popup
- A JSON file, containing all the necessary data for the template / popup

----------------

The frontend is supposed to be very helpful for our users. Allowing users to:

1. Drag & Drop elements from left bar
  - Cursor should change to the element while dragging when cursor is outside the canvas.
  - Canvas should represent where the element will be dropped when cursor is inside the canvas.
  - The dragged element should snap to:
    - Corners of the canvas
    - Edges of the other elements
    - Centers of the other elements
  with the sensitivity of 8px

2. Resize by dragging at the edges of canvas & elements, supporting everything listed above

More details can be found at "main/project-details-plain-text.txt".
NOTE!: Do read that file before answering any questions.

----------------

After all of this, don't start developing at all. This is only for you (QWEN) to understand what the project is supposed to be.

If you've understood this all, just let me know, say sth. like "I understood, what do we do next" or something like that.


----------------

let's work on our first drag & drop element, heading H

let's use vueuse/core, for snapping, for now, let's just add canvas 0,0
point and nothing else, left-bar elements should not move, create a new copy and
move the copy, until mouse enters the canvas, once it enters the canvas, we
should see an actual DOM element (you can keep id 20x20 red box for now) and
not the left-bar element. lets keep the changes small and proceed with small steps
